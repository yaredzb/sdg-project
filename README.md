![alt text](public/screenshot.png)

## 🌍 Overview
The **Real-Time SDG Collaboration Dashboard** is a web-based platform designed to **track, analyze, and enhance global partnerships** under **Sustainable Development Goal 17 (SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals)**. The dashboard provides real-time data insights on partnerships, funding allocations, and project impact through **AI-driven analytics and interactive visualizations**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Fetches data from sources like **UN SDG API, World Bank, and NGO reports**.
- **AI/ML-Based Predictions**: Uses **LSTM and Prophet models** to analyze trends in partnerships and funding.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Displays data using **graphs, charts, and maps** for easy interpretation.
- **Collaboration Insights**: AI-driven recommendations for potential partnerships and resource allocation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Dash/Streamlit** for an intuitive experience.
